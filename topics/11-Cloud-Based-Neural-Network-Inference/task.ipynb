    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural network inference is a time- and energy-consuming task, with state-of-the-art models growing ever more complex. Current (5G) and future (6G) communication technologies promise to offer high-bandwidth, low-latency communication. Both these trends suggest to off-load neural network inference (and possibly other driving functions) from running on automated vehicles to connected cloud servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is about evaluating two possible methodologies for cloud-based inference against each other. Semantic image segmentation is considered as the exemplary application.\n",
    "1. Equivalent ROS-based setup on both vehicle and cloud server with MQTT-based transmission of ROS messages\n",
    "   - vehicle camera publishes images on vehicle's ROS network;\n",
    "   - MQTT bridge on vehicle sends ROS image messages via MQTT broker to MQTT bridge on cloud server, where images are again available as ROS messages;\n",
    "   - ROS node for neural network inference on cloud server computes semantic segmentation image using a trained model;\n",
    "   - MQTT bridge on cloud server sends ROS segmentation image messages via MQTT broker to MQTT bridge on vehicle, where segmentation images are again available as ROS messages.\n",
    "1. Cloud-server acting as inference server only using [TensorFlow Serving RESTful API](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/api_rest)\n",
    "   - vehicle camera publishes images on vehicle's ROS network;\n",
    "   - cloud server is serving a trained model via TensorFlow Serving RESTful API;\n",
    "   - ROS node on vehicle pre-processes the camera image for a call to the cloud's RESTful API;\n",
    "   - ROS node on vehicle post-processes the API's response (model output) to publish the semantic segmentation image."

    "### Computer Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of having to use two separate computers (one to represent the vehicle, one for the cloud server), the methodology can also be developed entirely on a single machine. The components of the data flow stay the same, but all components are running on the same computer. For the MQTT approach this means that only one MQTT bridge is running, which is sending data to itself (e.g., data on ROS topic `/vehicle/image` is sent to the MQTT broker, received by the same MQTT bridge, and re-published on the same computer on ROS topic `/cloud/image`).\n",

Please let us know if you encounter problems serving this format with TensorFlow Serving. We could then potentially export the models in the newer *TensorFlow SavedModel* format."
