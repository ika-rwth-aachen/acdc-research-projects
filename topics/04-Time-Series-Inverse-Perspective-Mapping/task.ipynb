    "\n",
    "Grid maps play an important role in environment perception and may be used for purposes such as lane detection or free space detection. One way to compute semantic grid maps is to geometrically transform semantically segmented camera images using *Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM)*. One exemplary semantic grid map computed from 8 semantically segmented camera images is shown below.\n",

    "The classical IPM approach has several shortcomings due to its assumption of a flat world:\n",
    "- objects with vertical extent (e.g., cars) are heavily distorted;\n",
    "- flat world assumption is often wrong even for seemingly flat surfaces like roads (leading to, e.g., non-parallel lane markers in grid map);\n",
    "- effective resolution drops with distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One idea to improve on the basic IPM approach is to fuse camera image information from multiple consecutive time steps by involving information about the ego motion of the automated vehicle."

    "There is no obvious answer to the question of which information in which representation to fuse for this task. One reasonable option is to fuse the segmentation model's raw output, i.e., before it is converted to a semantic segmentation map using `argmax`. The raw model output usually is the output of a `softmax` activation, which can be interpreted to contain semantic class probabilities for every image pixel. The following code snippets walk you through the idea."
